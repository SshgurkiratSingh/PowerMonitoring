## CCMS Portal UI Overhaul - May 23, 2024 (Updated)

This document outlines the changes made to the `PowerManagement_Portal` Next.js application to implement a new user interface as per the user request. The focus was on a sleek, dark-themed UI with vibrant gradients, modern typography, glassmorphism effects, and the use of HeroUI components. This update includes a comprehensive review and styling of all components within the `PowerManagement_Portal/components/` directory.

### 1. Dependency Updates & Setup

*   **Installed HeroUI:** Added `@heroui/react` to the project dependencies.
*   **Tailwind CSS Configuration:** Verified that `tailwind.config.js` was correctly configured to use the HeroUI theme and components.

### 2. Core Page Updates

*   **Home Page (`app/page.tsx`):**
    *   Complete content overhaul to reflect CCMS features (Remote Control, Schedule Programming, Group Management) using HeroUI `Card` and `Button` components.
    *   Full-page gradient background, gradient text effects, and glassmorphism for content cards.
*   **About Page (`app/about/page.tsx`):**
    *   Expanded content detailing the CCMS portal's mission, features, security, and scalability.
    *   Consistent dark gradient background, gradient text, and glassmorphic cards for content sections.

### 3. Component-Level Updates (`PowerManagement_Portal/components/`)

*   **Navbar (`components/navbar.tsx`):**
    *   Ensured Navbar uses HeroUI components (`HeroUINavbar`, `NavbarContent`, etc.).
    *   Applied dark theme and glassmorphism: semi-transparent dark background with backdrop blur, updated text/icon colors for visibility (`text-slate-200`, `text-slate-400`, `hover:text-sky-400`), and styled search input/sponsor button.
    *   Updated logo text to "CCMS".
    *   This file was explicitly overwritten to ensure the latest styles were applied.

*   **Icons (`components/icons.tsx`):**
    *   Refactored the file to better suit the CCMS portal's needs.
    *   **Removed:** `DiscordIcon`, `TwitterIcon`, and `HeartFilledIcon` as they were deemed non-essential for the core application.
    *   **Renamed:** The generic `Logo` component was renamed to `AppLogoIcon` to clarify its role as a placeholder application logo. The Navbar was updated to use `AppLogoIcon`.
    *   **Kept:** `GithubIcon` (for potential source code/issue tracker links), `MoonFilledIcon` and `SunFilledIcon` (essential for theme switching), and `SearchIcon` (used in Navbar).
    *   All remaining icons continue to use `currentColor` for fills/strokes, ensuring adaptability to CSS-driven styling.

*   **Theme Switch (`components/theme-switch.tsx`):**
    *   Adjusted the styling of the HeroUI-based switch.
    *   Changed icon coloring from a generic `!text-default-500` to `text-slate-400 hover:text-sky-400 transition-colors` to match other icons in the Navbar for better visual consistency.

*   **Primitives (`components/primitives.ts`):**
    *   Reviewed `title` and `subtitle` style definitions.
    *   `title` styles were deemed suitable for the dark theme.
    *   Updated the `subtitle` base style's default text color from `text-default-600` to `text-slate-300` for improved contrast and consistency on dark backgrounds.

*   **Counter (`components/counter.tsx`):**
    *   Wrapped the HeroUI `Button` in a `div` styled with glassmorphism effects (`p-4 bg-slate-800/60 backdrop-blur-lg border border-slate-700/50 rounded-xl shadow-xl inline-block`).
    *   Styled the `Button` itself with `variant="ghost"`, `color="primary"`, and custom classes for a sky-blue border and text, with hover effects (`border-sky-500 text-sky-400 hover:bg-sky-500 hover:text-white`).
    *   Increased text size using `text-lg`.

### 4. Global Styles (`styles/globals.css`)

*   **Dark Theme Defaults:** Established `bg-slate-900` and `text-slate-200` for the `body`. Headings use `text-slate-100`.
*   **Modern Typography:** Implemented a system UI font stack for `html` for fast, modern fonts and added `scroll-behavior: smooth;`.
*   **Utility Classes:** Included helper classes like `.glass-effect` and example text gradient classes.
*   Verified these global styles support all component and page-level UI changes.

### Summary of UI Aesthetic Achieved:

*   **Dark Theme:** Consistently applied across all updated pages and components.
*   **Vibrant Gradients:** Used for page backgrounds and prominent text.
*   **Modern Typography:** System UI font stack for clean and fast rendering.
*   **Smooth Glassmorphism Effects:** Applied to Navbar, cards, buttons, and content containers.
*   **HeroUI Components:** Leveraged for core UI elements and styling foundation.

This comprehensive update ensures a cohesive and modern user experience across the CCMS portal, aligning with the requested visual style and functionality.
