# Remove Login Implementation

## Changes Made
- Removed login page and authentication system
- Simplified middleware to allow all routes by default
- Updated navbar component to remove login/logout functionality
- Removed authentication state checks from components
- Removed login-related API routes

## Motivation
As per requirements, the login system is being removed to simplify the application flow and prevent login-related redirect issues. The application will now use only sudo password verification when needed for specific actions.

## Technical Details
1. Middleware changes:
   - Removed JWT verification
   - Removed login redirects
   - Simplified route handling

2. Navbar changes:
   - Removed authentication state
   - Removed login/logout buttons
   - Simplified navigation menu
   - Kept core navigation and search functionality

3. Removed files:
   - /app/login/page.tsx
   - /app/api/auth/* routes

## Testing
- Verify all pages are accessible without login
- Confirm no redirects to login page
- Test navigation menu functionality
- Ensure search and theme switch still work

## Notes
- SudoPassword verification remains in place for sensitive operations
- Application security now relies on network-level and sudo-based access control
