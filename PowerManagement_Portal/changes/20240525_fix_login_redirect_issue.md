# Fix Login Redirect Issue After Authentication

## Problem
Users were being redirected to the login page even after successfully logging in with correct credentials, despite the logout button being visible at the top.

## Changes Made

1. Updated AuthContext (app/contexts/auth-context.tsx):
   - Improved login function to properly handle authentication state
   - Added proper error handling and state management
   - Modified handleRouteChange to be more robust and handle edge cases
   - Fixed race condition between auth state and route changes
   - Using router.replace instead of router.push to prevent navigation history issues

2. Updated Login Page (app/login/page.tsx):
   - Enhanced error handling and user feedback
   - Improved login flow with proper state management
   - Added better error messages from the API
   - Using router.replace for cleaner navigation

## Testing

1. Verify authentication flow:
   - Login with correct credentials should redirect to dashboard
   - Login state should persist across page reloads
   - Protected routes should remain accessible after login
   - Logout should properly clear auth state

2. Error handling:
   - Invalid credentials should show proper error message
   - Network errors should be handled gracefully
   - Edge cases in authentication flow should be handled properly

## Security Considerations

- Using httpOnly cookies for JWT storage
- Implementing proper token validation
- Using secure routing and authentication checks
- Following security best practices for authentication flow

## Performance Impact

- Minimal impact on performance
- Improved state management reduces unnecessary rerenders
- Better error handling prevents UI freezes
