# Fix Login Redirect Issue

## Changes Made
1. Enhanced AuthContext implementation:
   - Added proper route protection with public/private route handling
   - Added loading state management
   - Improved auth state persistence across page navigation
   - Added Cache-Control headers to prevent stale auth states
   - Added loading spinner for better UX during auth checks

2. Key Improvements:
   - Fixed issue where pages would redirect to login even when authenticated
   - Added proper auth state checking on route changes
   - Improved error handling and user feedback
   - Added loading states to prevent flash of incorrect content

3. Technical Details:
   - Added `isLoading` to AuthContext interface
   - Implemented separate `handleRouteChange` function for better route management
   - Added public routes array for better route protection
   - Added loading spinner component using Tailwind CSS
   - Improved error handling in auth check function

## Testing
1. Verify that authenticated users can access protected routes
2. Verify that unauthenticated users are redirected to login
3. Verify that authenticated users are redirected from public routes to dashboard
4. Verify that auth state persists across page refreshes
5. Verify loading states are shown during auth checks

## Security Considerations
- Added Cache-Control headers to prevent stale auth states
- Improved error handling to prevent information leakage
- Maintained secure cookie handling with credentials: "include"
