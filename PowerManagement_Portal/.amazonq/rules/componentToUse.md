1. Use heroui components for UI elements instead of nextui as it has been renamed to heroui . use syntax import {Button, ButtonGroup} from "@heroui/button";
2. always create a readme file in changes folder with changes made and name that file according to user request .
3. prefer heroui components only or custom components
4. the ui should feature sleek, dark-themed UI with vibrant gradients, modern typography, and smooth glassmorphism effects,fast, accessible
5. use heroui components for all UI elements, including buttons, inputs, and cards.
